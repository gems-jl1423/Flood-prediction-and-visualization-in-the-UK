    "**Description**: The regularize method takes a list of postcodes and a specified geographic level as input parameters and returns the regularized postcodes based on the specified level. The supported geographic levels are 'all', 'area', 'district', and 'sector'. If an invalid level is provided, it defaults to 'all'. The method then cleans the input postcodes by converting them to uppercase, removing extra whitespaces, and formatting it consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it extracts the area, district, sector, and unit components from the postcodes. The regularized postcodes are constructed based on the specified geographic level. If 'all' is chosen, the method returns the full regularized postcodes. For 'area', it returns only the area components. For 'district', it concatenates the area and district components. For 'sector', it returns the area, district, and sector components.\n",

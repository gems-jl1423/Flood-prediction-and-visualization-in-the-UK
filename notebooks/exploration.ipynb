    "**Description**: The get_postcode_from_lat_long function takes latitude and longitude as input parameters. It first checks if the coordinates fall within an accepted geographic range by comparing them to the minimum and maximum values obtained from the find_min_max_lat method. If the coordinates are within range, it calculates the easting and northing using get_easting_northing_from_gps_lat_long and then determines the closest postcode with get_closest_postcode_from_easting_northing. The function returns the resulting postcode. If the coordinates are outside the accepted range, it prints a message and returns None to signify an invalid input. This helps ensure the function processes only valid coordinates."
